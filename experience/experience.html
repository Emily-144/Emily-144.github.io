            I typically like to provide more information than I can fit on my resume, so I highlight my work experience here.
            Feel free to reach out to me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ecgross/">LinkedIn</a> if you are interested in learning more or would like a copy of my resume!

        <h2>Northwestern Mutual</h2>

        <h3>Software Engineer</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><i>Coming soon! :)</i></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Infrastructure & Cloud Services Intern</h3>
        <h4>Franklin, WI | May 2024 - August 2024</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Built a centralized API integrated with Apache Kafka that greatly streamlines the development process for roughly 90 applications with 800 topics,
                enabling over 400 developers to test their application code more securely, rapidly, and easily.
            </li>
            <li>
                Found and implemented innovative, customer-oriented solutions for leveraging Apache Kafka across the enterprise more efficiently and collaborated with various teams.
            </li>
            <li>
                Presented my API at the ICS Town Hall, Intern Showcase, and to my team.
            </li>
            <li>
                Participated in the <a href="https://vote.lightthehoan.com/?_gl=1%2A9ccd5f%2A_ga%2AMTg3OTYxNTA2MC4xNzQxNjY0MjE1%2A_ga_7Z3RERET8D%2AMTc0MTY2NDIxNC4xLjEuMTc0MTY2NDIzOS4wLjAuMA..">Light the Hoan Intern Challenge</a>,
                where I animated the iconic <i>Train and Ox</i> painting (by Jose Lerma) that showcases Northwestern Mutual's roots.
                My team did not represent Northwestern Mutual at the event, but I had a blast supporting the winning team and watching the other companies' light shows!

        <h2>University of Wisconsin - Madison</h2>

        <h3>WordPress Developer</h3>
        <h4>Madison, WI | October 2024 - Present</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Improved the Simulation-Based Engineering Lab (SBEL) website by reorganizing pages, simplifying the interface,
                and adding engaging information and aspects to enhance the user experience and improve the lab's outreach.
            </li>
            <li>
                Displayed here is the home page banner I edited, showcasing the lab's talent for creating simulation models
                using their open-source physics software, <a href="https://projectchrono.org/">Chrono</a>.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee at Waukesha</h2>

        <h3>AV/IT Technician</h3>
        <h4>Waukesha, WI | March 2023 - Present</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Optimized inventory model twice: First, increased Windows 11-compatible computers by 30% and decreased older ones by 19% within 4 months,
                and second, migrated various spreadsheets to a centralized database to create a more flexible environment for the relational data.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The database was created with Access and VBA programming.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I migrated the inventory model from various Excel spreadsheets to a more dynamic platform
                        that allowed us to properly document interweaving information and efficiently migrate computers during the UWM-Waukesha closing process.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <li>
                Performed troubleshooting on hardware, software, and network issues, conducted hardware diagnostics, and installed/supported technology for classrooms and events.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Event speakers include university professors, Greta Van Susteren, David Zucker, and members of the Wisconsin state.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Fun fact: For my Optimization course, I created a model to predict the optimal computer moving schedule for UWM-Waukesha, focusing on efficiency while not sacrificing the current student experience.
            </li>
        </ul>
