        <h1>Favorites</h1>
        <p>
            I enjoy lots of different types of media, and I particularly love seeing the little details and creative efforts in things that show how passionate the creators were.
            Here, I briefly talk about some of my favorite franchises. I'm always open to new recommendations, too!
        </p>

        <h2>Books</h2>
        <p>
            One of my favorite book series, that I got hooked on as a kid and am still reading (since the books never end -- there's roughly 100), is <i>Warriors</i>!
            <i>Warriors</i> is a young adult fiction series about groups of cats who live in the wild.
        </p>
        <p>
            I tend to enjoy animal-focused stories, so I like reading anything about animals (except those books where the dog dies in the end).
            Some of my other childhood favorites are <i>Watership Down</i>, the <i>Wings of Fire</i> series (by one of the authors of <i>Warriors</i>), and <i>Wolves of the Beyond</i>.
        </p>

        <h2>Movies and TV Shows</h2>
        <p>
            I am a huge <i>Star Wars</i> nerd and have watched every movie and TV show that the franchise has produced.
            Ever since my dad introduced 8-year-old me to the movies, I have been a huge fan.
            My favorites include <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i> and <i>The Clone Wars</i> TV series. The Thrawn Legends books are on my reading list!
            I love AT-AT walkers in particular, and I have a growing collection of LEGO AT-AT walkers.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also love well-crafted animated media.
            Kids shows like <i>Gravity Falls</i>, <i>Amphibia</i>, and <i>The Owl House</i> do a great job of combining lighthearted jokes with darker themes to make their plots more engaging,
            and movies like the <i>How to Train Your Dragon</i> trilogy, <i>Puss in Boots: The Last Wish</i>, and Pixar's <i>Up</i> and <i>WALL-E</i> have gorgeous animation in addition to meaningful messages and iconic soundtracks.
        </p>

        <h2>Videogames</h2>
        <p>
            I tend to enjoy videogames with some sort of adventure and story aspect to them. I grew up playing all sorts of <i>Mario</i> games, and I like to think I'm pretty good at <i>Mario Kart</i>.
            Of course, I have also played multiple <i>Lego Star Wars</i> games.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of my all-time favorites are <i>Stardew Valley</i>, <i>Hollow Knight</i> (and probably <i>Silksong</i> whenever it comes out ?!), <i>Minecraft</i>, <i>Terraria</i>, and <i>Animal Crossing</i>.
        </p>
