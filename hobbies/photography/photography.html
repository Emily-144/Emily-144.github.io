        <h1>Photography</h1>
        <p>
            I have been pursuing photography, particularly wildlife photography, since I was 12.
            Animals are my favorite subjects, but I also like shooting landscapes and any sort of creative idea that comes to mind!
            Photography is technically a type of art, but I wanted to create another page for it since it is different than my other art.
        </p>

            My dad and I both enjoy photography, and we have taken many great photos both near home and on vacation.
            We love travelling to National Parks and going on photography hikes to capture the iconic scenery and wildlife.
