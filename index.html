		<h1>Hello, world!</h1>

		<p>
			My name is Emily Gross. I'm currently in my senior year of college studying computer science and mathematics.
			I am passionate about integrating creativity and technology to enhance user experience and <i>make cool things</i>!

		<h2>My Programming Journey</h2>
		<dl>
			<dt>Swift</dt>
			<dd>
				Swift is the first programming language I learned. I took an App Development course in high school and fell in love with coding.
				I actually won the <a href="https://www.unchartedlearning.org/blog/mobilemakersedu-winter-contest-2019/2020-winners-announced">MobileMakersEdu Winter Contest</a> too,
				which helped me realize that this might be something I should pursue for a career!
			</dd>

			<dt>JavaScript</dt>
			<dd>
				The second programming language I learned was JavaScript. I first used it in high school to add onto my HTML/CSS websites,
				then used it in some side projects. I also primarily used JavaScript (specifically Node.js) during my internship at Northwestern Mutual to create an API.
				I dabbled in React during a hackathon, where my group aimed to securely digitalize the voting process to make it more accessible.
			</dd>

			<dt>Java</dt>
			<dd>
				For both of the colleges I went to, Java was used as the introductory programming language.
				I learned object-oriented programming and the main data structures with Java.
				I am currently using Java to write solutions for my Algorithms class and create a compiler in my Compilers class.
			</dd>

			<dt>C</dt>
			<dd>
				For both Machine Organization and Operating Systems, I used C to create numerous low-level projects,
				such as a memory allocator, UNIX shell, and file system.
			</dd>

			<dt>Python</dt>
			<dd>
				Most of my Python experience comes from small, fun side projects, like a Discord bot or pong game.
				I also used Flask during a hackathon with the Geolocation API.
				For my Optimization class, I used GAMSPy and Plotly to create models, including a project where I optimized computer migration for organizations,
				such as my workplace, UWM-Waukesha.
			</dd>
