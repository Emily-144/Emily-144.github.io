			<h2>My Programming Journey</h2>
			<dl>
				<dt>Swift</dt>
				<dd>
					Swift is the first programming language I learned. I took an App Development course in high school and fell in love with coding.
					I actually won the <a href="https://www.unchartedlearning.org/blog/mobilemakersedu-winter-contest-2019/2020-winners-announced">MobileMakersEdu Winter Contest</a> too,
					which helped me realize that this might be something I should pursue for a career!
				</dd>

				<dt>JavaScript</dt>
				<dd>
					The second programming language I learned was JavaScript. I first used it in high school to add onto my HTML/CSS websites,
					then used it in some side projects. I also primarily used JavaScript (specifically Node.js) during my internship at Northwestern Mutual to create an API.
					I dabbled in React during a hackathon, where my group aimed to securely digitalize the voting process to make it more accessible.
				</dd>

				<dt>Java</dt>
				<dd>
					For both of the colleges I went to, Java was used as the introductory programming language.
					I learned object-oriented programming and the main data structures with Java.
					I am currently using Java to write solutions for my Algorithms class and create a compiler in my Compilers class.
				</dd>

				<dt>C</dt>
				<dd>
					For both Machine Organization and Operating Systems, I used C to create numerous low-level projects,
					such as a memory allocator, UNIX shell, and file system.
				</dd>

				<dt>Python</dt>
				<dd>
					Most of my Python experience comes from small, fun side projects, like a Discord bot or pong game.
					I also used Flask during a hackathon with the Geolocation API.
					For my Optimization class, I used GAMSPy and Plotly to create models, including a project where I optimized computer migration for organizations,
					such as my workplace, UWM-Waukesha.
				</dd>
